The `npm run` commands above basically trigger gulp without having to install 
a global dependency. For fine grained control of tasks, install gulp globally
 with `npm install --global gulp` and then run `gulp help` for a list of all 
 available tasks.

Add anything to `gulpfile.js` that you want! Also, you can copy any file from 
`node_modules/p2-theme-core/lib/` into your repo and use it as a starting point 
(may need to install packages from `p2-theme-core` too.)

Many of the features can be turned off, for example if we didn't want all the JS 
features like linting and concatenation, just toggle `enabled` under `js` in 
`gulpconfig.yml`. So you'd just open `gulpconfig.yml` and change this:

```diff
js:
-    enabled: true
+    enabled: false
```
