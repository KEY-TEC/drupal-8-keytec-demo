## Icon font

All SVG files in `icons/src/` - are combined into an icon font and have classes 
and Sass mixins made for each based on file name. See `Atoms` / `Icons` in 
Pattern Lab.

To ensure correct sizing of all icons in this font. The source icons should be 
imported into the `icons/icons.sketch` Sketch file on a separate canvas.

**NOTICE:** Please inform other team members when making changes to the Sketch 
file to avoid binary merge conflicts!
